	abstract = {Harmful (toxic, food web altering, hypoxia generating) cyanobacterial algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are proliferating world-wide due to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, and they represent a serious threat to the use and sustainability of our freshwater resources. Traditionally, phosphorus (P) input reductions have been prescribed to control CyanoHABs, because P limitation is widespread and some CyanoHABs can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to satisfy their nitrogen (N) requirements. However, eutrophying systems are increasingly plagued with non N2 fixing CyanoHABs that are N and P co-limited or even N limited. In many of these systems N loads are increasing faster than P loads. Therefore N and P input constraints are likely needed for long-term CyanoHAB control in such systems. Climatic changes, specifically warming, increased vertical stratification, salinization, and intensification of storms and droughts play additional, interactive roles in modulating CyanoHAB frequency, intensity, geographic distribution and duration. In addition to having to consider reductions in N and P inputs, water quality managers are in dire need of effective tools to break the synergy between nutrient loading and hydrologic regimes made more favorable for CyanoHABs by climate change. The more promising of these tools make affected waters less hospitable for CyanoHABs by 1) altering the hydrology to enhance vertical mixing and/or flushing and 2) decreasing nutrient fluxes from organic rich sediments by physically removing the sediments or capping sediments with clay. Effective future CyanoHAB management approaches must incorporate both N and P loading dynamics within the context of altered thermal and hydrologic regimes associated with climate change.},

	abstract = {The trophic history of Lake Champlain's northeastern arm was assessed using a multi-proxy paleolimnological approach to provide sub-basin specific information for restoration planning. Sediment cores collected from Missisquoi Bay, St. Albans Bay, and the central Northeast Arm (Inland Sea) were analyzed for nutrients, organic carbon, carbon stable isotopes, biogenic silica, pigments, diatoms and soft algae microfossils. Results indicate that this arm of Lake Champlain was oligotrophic when Europeans arrived in 1609, and that clearance of {\textgreater}70\% of catchment forest cover had minor impact on algal production. Instead, eutrophication of St. Albans Bay was concurrent with sewer installation and expansion in early 20th century, and again with urban development in the 1960–70s. In contrast, less urbanized Missisquoi Bay remained mesotrophic until agriculture intensified after 1970. Interpretation of central Northeast Arm trophic history is complicated because road and railroad causeways built in 19th century reduced sediment input to this basin for several decades. Nevertheless, high surface-sediment concentrations of nutrients, pigments and organic matter along with replacement of Cyclotella bodanica with more eutrophic Fragilaria crotonensis suggest substantial eutrophication in deep as well as shallow water after 1970. We conclude that effective restoration of the northeastern arm is possible, but will require stringent control of animal and human wastes and reduced use of crop fertilizers.},

	abstract = {It is well established that cyanobacteria populations in shallow lakes exhibit dramatic fluctuations on both interannual and intraannual timescales; however, despite extensive research, disentangling the drivers of interannual variability in bloom severity has proved challenging. Critical thresholds of abiotic drivers such as wind, irradiance, air temperature, and tributary inputs may control the development and collapse of blooms, but these thresholds are difficult to identify in large and complex datasets. In this study, we compared high-frequency estimates of oxygen metabolism in a shallow bay of Lake Champlain to concurrent measurements of physical and chemical parameters over 3 years with very different bloom dynamics. We clustered the data using supervised and unsupervised self-organizing maps to identify the environmental drivers associated with key stages of bloom development. We then used threshold analysis to identify subtle yet important thresholds of thermal stratification that drive transitions between bloom growth and decline. We found that extended periods with near-surface temperature differentials above 0.20 °C were associated with the initial development of bloom conditions, and subsequent frequency and timing of wind mixing events had a strong influence on interannual variability in bloom severity. The methods developed here can be widely applied to other high frequency lake monitoring datasets to identify critical thresholds controlling bloom development.},

	url = {https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2001/139109/abs/},
	abstract = {Suspended algae, or phytoplankton, are the prime source of organic matter supporting food webs in freshwater ecosystems. Phytoplankton productivity is reliant on adequate nutrient supplies; however, increasing rates of nutrient supply, much of it manmade, fuels accelerating primary production or eutrophication. An obvious and problematic symptom of eutrophication is rapid growth and accumulations of phytoplankton, leading to discoloration of affected waters. These events are termed blooms. Blooms are a prime agent of water quality deterioration, including foul odors and tastes, deoxygenation of bottom waters (hypoxia and anoxia), toxicity, fish kills, and food web alterations. Toxins produced by blooms can adversely affect animal (including human) health in waters used for recreational and drinking purposes. Numerous freshwater genera within the diverse phyla comprising the phytoplankton are capable of forming blooms; however, the blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) are the most notorious bloom formers. This is especially true for harmful toxic, surface-dwelling, scum-forming genera (e.g., Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Nodularia, Microcystis) and some subsurface bloom-formers (Cylindrospermopsis, Oscillatoria) that are adept at exploiting nutrient-enriched conditions. They thrive in highly productive waters by being able to rapidly migrate between radiance-rich surface waters and nutrient-rich bottom waters. Furthermore, many harmful species are tolerant of extreme environmental conditions, including very high light levels, high temperatures, various degrees of desiccation, and periodic nutrient deprivation. Some of the most noxious cyanobacterial bloom genera (e.g., Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis, Nodularia) are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen (N2), enabling them to periodically dominate under nitrogen-limited conditions. Cyanobacteria produce a range of organic compounds, including those that are toxic to higher-ranked consumers, from zooplankton to further up the food chain. Both N2- and non-N2-fixing genera participate in mutualistic and symbiotic associations with microorganisms, higher plants, and animals. These associations appear to be of great benefit to their survival and periodic dominance. In this review, we address the ecological impacts and environmental controls of harmful blooms, with an emphasis on the ecology, physiology, and management of cyanobacterial bloom taxa. Combinations of physical, chemical, and biotic features of natural waters function in a synergistic fashion to determine the sensitivity of water bodies. In waters susceptible to blooms, human activities in water- and airsheds have been linked to the extent and magnitudes of blooms. Control and management of cyanobacterial and other phytoplankton blooms invariably includes nutrient input constraints, most often focused on nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P). The types and amount of nutrient input constraints depend on hydrologic, climatic, geographic, and geologic factors, which interact with anthropogenic and natural nutrient input regimes. While single nutrient input constraints may be effective in some water bodies, dual N and P input reductions are usually required for effective long-term control and management of harmful blooms. In some systems where hydrologic manipulations (i.e., plentiful water supplies) are possible, reducing the water residence time by enhanced flushing and artificial mixing (in conjunction with nutrient input constraints) can be particularly effective alternatives. Implications of various management strategies, based on combined ecophysiological and environmental considerations, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the most ancient phytoplankton on the planet and form harmful algal blooms in freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. Recent research suggests that eutrophication and climate change are two processes that may promote the proliferation and expansion of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. In this review, we specifically examine the relationships between eutrophication, climate change and representative cyanobacterial genera from freshwater (Microcystis, Anabaena, Cylindrospermopsis), estuarine (Nodularia, Aphanizomenon), and marine ecosystems (Lyngbya, Synechococcus, Trichodesmium). Commonalities among cyanobacterial genera include being highly competitive for low concentrations of inorganic P (DIP) and the ability to acquire organic P compounds. Both diazotrophic (= nitrogen (N2) fixers) and non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria display great flexibility in the N sources they exploit to form blooms. Hence, while some cyanobacterial blooms are associated with eutrophication, several form blooms when concentrations of inorganic N and P are low. Cyanobacteria dominate phytoplankton assemblages under higher temperatures due to both physiological (e.g. more rapid growth) and physical factors (e.g. enhanced stratification), with individual species showing different temperature optima. Significantly less is known regarding how increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will affect cyanobacteria, although some evidence suggests several genera of cyanobacteria are well-suited to bloom under low concentrations of CO2. While the interactive effects of future eutrophication and climate change on harmful cyanobacterial blooms are complex, much of the current knowledge suggests these processes are likely to enhance the magnitude and frequency of these events.},

	abstract = {The long-standing assumption that the phytoplankton in Lake Champlain are phosphorus limited was tested through measurement of physiological indicators of phosphorus status (alkaline phosphatase activity and orthophosphate turnover time) and enrichment experiments conducted four times during the growth season. Phosphorus addition to experimental carboys incubated 4–5 days in situ substantially increased phytoplankton biomass relative to controls in June, but had only a mild impact in July and September, and no effect in May. Nitrogen addition augmented biomass in one of four experiments (in June), while silica had no impact at any time. In summer and fall, addition of N and P in combination always yielded more phytoplankton biomass than singular P addition. In spring, even combined addition of N, P, and Si failed to stimulate phytoplankton growth. The phytoplankton groups responding to fertilization were largely the same as those that flourished in controls (diatoms and green algae), suggesting that enclosure was a more powerful determinant of species composition than nutrient inputs. Orthophosphate turnover times and levels of alkaline phosphatase activity in the lake indicated spatial and temporal variability in phytoplantkon P status, with P sufficiency as common as P deficiency. We conclude that multiple interacting factors influence the abundance and species composition of phytoplankton in Lake Champlain. In spring, phytoplankton growth is not limited by N, Si, or P, but by some factor yet to be determined (perhaps light or temperature). In summer, P is the principal limiting nutrient, but N exerts an influence that deserves further investigation.},

Such changes may result in systematic shifts in lake N:P under future climate warming. We used 21 years of monitoring data to compare long-term and intra-annual trends in total N (TN), total P (TP) and TN:TP at 15 sites in Lake Champlain to concurrent measurements of watershed nutrient inputs and meteorological drivers. TN:TP declined sharply lake-wide, particularly in the past decade, yet the drivers of this trend varied based on site depth. In deep sites, declines were driven by changes in watershed loading of dissolved P and N and (in some cases) by decreases in hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen. In shallow sites, declines in TN:TP were primarily driven by long-term increases in temperature and decreases in wind speed, and exhibited systematic seasonal variability in TN:TP due to the timing of sediment P loading, N removal processes, and external nutrient inputs. We developed a conceptual model to explain the observed trends, and suggest that while climate drivers have affected nutrient dynamics in shallow and deep sites differently, both deep and shallow sites are likely to experience further declines in N:P and increases in cyanobacteria dominance if recent climate trends continue.},

	abstract = {Besides the many species representative of the major eukaryotic algal phyla, the freshwater phytoplankton comprises a number of cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae). These aggregations have earned recognition in their own collective term, “water blooms”. This chapter reviews the aspects of ecology of planktonic cyanobacreria in relation to the factors governing their buoyancy, population dynamics, and perennation in natural limnetic environments. The buoyant properties of cyanobacteria are assessed in relation to the Stokes equation, drawing distinctions between the differential contributions of size, density, and form resistance among individual genera. Density is altered through the erection or collapse of gas vesicles, their dilution by growth and through the maintenance of glycogen ballast. The outcome of buoyancy-controlled movements in natural fields of turbulent mixing is described in empirical terms. The chapter also reviews the growth requirements of cyanobacteria with respect to temperature, light, and nutrients together with their responses to deficiencies of supply. The outcome of interactions between buoyancy regulation and limiting resources are proposed in a series of hypothetical model environments. The circumstances under which excess buoyancy is acquired and expressed in surface bloom formation are re-examined. Adaptations for perennation and re-establishment of populations after bloom formation or other adverse conditions are reviewed. The evolutionary strategies of planktonic cyanobacteria are deduced.},

Upon examining combinations of environmental conditions most likely to elicit nuisance blooms, commonalities and analog situations become more apparent among coastal marine (dinoflagellate-dominated), estuarine (dinoflagellate- and cyanobacteria-dominated), and freshwater (cyanobacteria-dominated) ecosystems. A combination of the following hydrological, chemical, and biotic factors will most likely lead to bloom-sensitive waters: a horizontally distinct water mass; a vertically stratified water column; warm weather conditions, as typified by dry monsoon tropical climates and summer seasons in temperate zones; high incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); enhanced allochthonous organic matter loading (both as DOC and POC); enhanced allochthonous inorganic nutrient loading (nitrogen and/or phosphorus); adequate availability of essential metals, supplied by terrigenous inputs or upwelling; underlying sediments physically and nutritionally suitable as “seed beds” for resting cysts and akinetes; algal-bacterial synergism, which exhibits positive impacts on phycosphere nutrient cycling; algal-micrograzer (protists and rotifers) synergism, which also enhances nutrient cycling without consumption of filamentous and colonial nuisance taxa; and selective (for non-nuisance taxa) activities of macrograzers (crustacean zooplankton, larval fish). Nuisance bloom taxa share numerous additional physiological and ecological characteristics, including limited heterotrophic capabilities, high degrees of motility, and toxicity. Given such a set of commonalities, it would appear useful and timely to identify and address generally applicable criteria for deeming a water body “bloom sensitive” and to incorporate such criteria into the design of water quality management strategies applicable to both coastal marine and freshwater habitats.},

	abstract = {The shallow bays of Lake Champlain have experienced increasingly severe algal blooms over recent decades, but the drivers of inter- and intra-annual variability of bloom severity are poorly understood. Disentangling the relative importance of multiple processes driving cyanobacteria blooms is difficult, in part because traditional monitoring programs often lack adequate temporal resolution, and in part because many studies seek to identify a single dominant mechanism. In this study, a holistic approach was used to identify multiple drivers of a strong cyanobacterial bloom over time in a shallow, eutrophic bay of Lake Champlain utilizing high-temporal-resolution meteorological, water quality, and biogeochemical sensor data; an intensive field sampling program; and a long-term monitoring dataset. In contrast to studies in similar systems, spring runoff and nutrient loads could not explain the severity of the 2012 bloom. Instead, internal nutrient loading and hydrodynamic conditions mediated shifts in resource limitation. The cyanobacteria growth phase was associated with the depletion of available nitrogen and sediment phosphorus release. The peak bloom stage was characterized by multiple limiting resources and stable water column conditions. The decline phase of the bloom was associated with light limitation brought about by wind mixing, and was punctuated by a major storm event, which brought a major biogeochemical shift in the lake system. This study illustrates the complexity of cyanobacteria resource limitation in response to internal and external forcing over time, and also the power of comprehensive monitoring approaches in disentangling complex drivers of eutrophic ecosystem function that vary across temporal and spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria of the Baltic Sea have multiple effects on organisms that influence the food chain dynamics on several trophic levels. Cyanobacteria contain several bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids, peptides, and lipopolysaccharides. A group of nonribosomally produced oligopeptides, namely microcystins and nodularin, are tumor promoters and cause oxidative stress in the affected cells. Zooplankton graze on cyanobacteria, and when ingested, the hepatotoxins (nodularin) decrease the egg production of, for example, copepods. However, the observed effects are very variable, because many crustaceans are tolerant to nodularin and because cyanobacteria may complement the diet of grazers in small amounts. Cyanobacterial toxins are transferred through the food web from one trophic level to another. The transfer rate is relatively low in the pelagic food web, but reduced feeding and growth rates of fish larvae have been observed. In the benthic food web, especially in blue mussels, nodularin concentrations are high, and benthic feeding juvenile flounders have been observed to disappear from bloom areas. In the littoral ecosystem, gammarids have shown increased mortality and weakening of reproductive success under cyanobacterial exposure. In contrast, mysid shrimps seem to be tolerant to cyanobacterial exposure. In fish larvae, detoxication of nodularin poses a metabolic cost that is reflected as decreased growth and condition, which may increase their susceptibility to predation. Cyanobacterial filaments and aggregates also interfere with both hydromechanical and visual feeding of planktivores. The feeding appendages of mysid shrimps may clog, and the filaments interfere with prey detection of pike larvae. On the other hand, a cyanobacterial bloom may provide a refuge for both zooplankton and small fish. As the decaying bloom also provides an ample source of organic carbon and nutrients for the organisms of the microbial loop, the zooplankton species capable of selective feeding may thrive in bloom conditions. Cyanobacteria also compete for nutrients with other primary producers and change the nitrogen (N) : phosphorus (P) balance of their environment by their N-fixation. Further, the bioactive compounds of cyanobacteria directly influence other primary producers, favoring cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, dinoflagellates, and nanoflagellates and inhibiting cryptophytes. As the selective grazers also shift the grazing pressure on other species than cyanobacteria, changes in the structure and functioning of the Baltic Sea communities and ecosystems are likely to occur during the cyanobacterial bloom season.},
