## Introduction 

* why important to study 
* cite a few other studies doing similar work 
* end intro with "in this study" paragraph to set up reader to how we plan to attack the problem 
* hypotheses? 
* Figs for this section: 
  + map of study area 
  + bar graph of cyanobacteria bloom timing being different every year (long-term monitoring)

## Methods 

* study sites 
* data used and how prepped 
  + buoy sensor data (MC)
  + meteorological station data (WB): air temp, solar radiation, wind speed, wind direction
  + discharge data (WB)
* data analysis - feature important (HC)


## Results  

* fig of time series of the parameters to set the scene? 
* which set of feature importance do we want to use? 

## Discussion 


## Future work

INFO ON HOW TO CITE in .Rmd from https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html : 

* Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. Here are some examples:
  + Blah blah [@isles_modeling_2017].
* Then in Zotero create a `.BibTex` file by going to File --> Export Library --> change to BibTex
